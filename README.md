# Alexis Portfolio

## Description

My motivation for this project was to make a solid looking portfolio that shows off the major parts of my skills while showing a little bit about me.
I build this project because I believe a good, proper portfolio can really make the difference for employers or anyone looking to find someone with my skills to help stand out and really show what makes my skills as a web developer different from everyone else.
Having my portfolio finished means I can go out and apply for jobs with confidence knowing I have a clean and proper website and page for people to see when they wanna learn more about me and my work.
